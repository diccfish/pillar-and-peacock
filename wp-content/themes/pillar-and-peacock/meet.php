				<h3>Brandeis Short</h3>
				<p>Authentic | Passionate | Dedicated | Connective | Visual<br /><br />
				Everyone has a story to tell. When we are able to contribute to that story through design, my passion comes alive. My favorite part of what we do is the process of internalizing what our client has communicated to us and translating it into something tangibly beautiful, unique and true. It has to be right. It has to be authentic. It has to be you. <br /><br />What A says about B: Once a ballerina, always a red-head...simultaneously graceful and fiery.</p>

				<h3>Adrianne Bugg</h3>
				<p>Visual | Artistic | Driven | Zealous | Inspired<br /><br />
				It makes me smile when I walk into a room in my house that is carefully designed and totally "me". It makes me even happier when we make our clients feel this way; that their space is unique to them, loving it so much that I know we've done what we were hired to do: partner with our client to look through the design lens and make the collective vision come to life. It's the fulfillment of my own dream that I get to help fulfill dreams of others. What B says about A: Bold enough to wear a pixie, old-school enough to only wear linen after Easter.</p>

			<p>In the early days, Adrianne pursued a Finance degree at Tulane University in New Orleans. Adrianne cut her teeth in the business world while playing with art and design on the side. She brings the necessary skills to run a business while also having that innate sense of design you just can't teach. <br /><br />
			Brandeis obtained her degree in Art History and Dance then decided to pursue interior design at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, VA. After obtaining her Interior Design degree, Brandeis worked with 3North, an architecture, interior design firm. She also has that unteachable sense of design and adds a critical depth of technical experience to the table that makes every project seamless.<br /><br />
			Together we have over 10 years of experience in the design field. We have worked on every kind of project: boutique hospitality such as Bedford Springs Resort and Grove Park Inn, to high-end residential design, to additions, renovations, and design from the ground up. Our individual experiences make us the perfect complement to each other and to your design project. We truly are "the perfect balance of form and function."</p>
